 * Deploying a application can require some repetitive work.
 *  For example, make all shared libraries available to the
 *  the end user can be done using existing tools
 *  (like ldd on Linux, or Dependency Walker on Windows).
 *  Using those tools helps to see which libraries to provide,
 *  but they do not copy them automatically.
 *  This is one use case this library can help.
 *
 * Classes are available in the Mdt::DeployUtils namespace.
